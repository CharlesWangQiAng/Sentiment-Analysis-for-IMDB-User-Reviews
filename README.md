# Sentiment-Analysis-for-IMDB-User-Reviews
# Overview
In this project, sentiment analysis was conducted on the IMDB User Reviews dataset using a transformer encoder. The data underwent thorough preprocessing, including the removal of missing values, sequence padding, and user labeling based on their comments. Word2Vec was employed to process user comments, and data loaders were created using TensorDataset for efficient handling. The project defined an embedding layer with positional encoding and constructed a transformer encoder model incorporating multi-head attention, layer normalization, and feed-forward mechanisms. The self-built model was trained, evaluated, and tested, achieving a commendable test accuracy of 83.05%. Additionally, the model demonstrated effectiveness in making inferences on self-generated reviews, showcasing its robustness in sentiment prediction. This project exemplifies the application of transformer-based models for sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights into user sentiments in the context of IMDB movie reviews.
